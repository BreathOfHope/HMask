# HMask
## the face mask project for HEPA filters


Hepa filters offers 99.97% filtering efficiency at 0.3 micron for particulate matter, hence can be used to filter out viruses. The aim of current project is to create a design for face mask using hepa filter.

Target is to build a mask without using stitching which will reduce the build time. The design is inspired from origami airplane design. Since hepa filters are used in car cabin filters, air purifiers and vacuum cleaners, it may be possible to mass produce hepa filters.  Combined with short build time for Hmask , we will be able to produce face masks in case we run short of N95 masks. Detailed testing need to be carried out to qualify Hmask as an N95 equivalent mask.
